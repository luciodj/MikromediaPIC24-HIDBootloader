PIC24 Mikromedia HID Bootloader
===============================

### What is this repository for?

-   This repository contains the source code for a cross platform version of the
    HID Bootloader designed to work with the popular PIC24 Mikromedia boards
    featured in the book "Graphics, Touch, Sound and USB"
    (http://blog.flyingpic24.com/gtsu)

-   The project was born out of the lack of support of the Mikroelektronika HID
    Bootloader for OS X and Linux (currently available only on Windows)

-   The application is written in Python and uses only the standard "Tkinter"
    GUI library for maximum portability across OS X, Linux and Windows.

-   The application can run in command line mode as well as in GUI mode (use the
    -gui command line switch)

Dependencies:

-   Python 2.7

-   Tkinter (for the GUI)

-   HID API wrapper (pip install hidapi  ensure you have v.7.99post17 or later)
